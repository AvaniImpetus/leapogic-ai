    "Question": "How does LeapLogic convert the QUALIFY clause from Teradata to PySpark?",
    "Answer": "Based on the provided knowledge base, LeapLogic handles the conversion of Teradata code to PySpark in several ways:\n\n*   **QUALIFY Clause:** It converts the `QUALIFY` clause into a subquery (`DerivedTable`) and moves the condition to a `WHERE` clause in the outer query.\n*   **Casting:** It automatically applies `CAST` functions to ensure data type compatibility during `INSERT` operations.\n*   **COALESCE:** It wraps columns with `COALESCE` functions to handle null entries for tables with `NOT NULL` constraints.\n*   **Collate Handling:** It applies `rtrim()` for collation and `upper()` for case-insensitive comparisons.\n*   **View to Table Replacement:** It replaces INSERT into views with the underlying table names.\n*   **Multi-Argument COALESCE:** It nests `COALESCE` functions to handle multiple arguments.\n*   **Asterisk (\\*) Replacement:** It replaces `SELECT *` with explicit column names in view conversions.\n*   **Identity Column Conversion:** It converts Teradata's `IDENTITY` columns to a simplified PySpark equivalent (e.g., `IDENTITY (1, 1)`).\n*   **Naming Conventions:** It converts all columns and tables to lowercase.\n*   **Casting & Coalesce in Nested Queries:** It optimizes by applying casting and COALESCE only in the outermost query.\n*   **Database Name Parameterization:** It parameterizes database names for flexibility across environments.\n*   **Generated Reports and Outputs:** It generates validation reports and consolidated outputs for quality assurance.\n\n\n\n",
